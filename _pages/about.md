I am an AI Development Engineer at Alibaba. I received my master's degree from the Intelligent Software Engineering Laboratory (ISE) at the Software Institute of Nanjing University under the supervision of Prof. Chen Zhenyu.

At Alibaba, I am a member of the ACoder project team, where I work on building AI-native capabilities and conduct research related to AI business applications. My research interests focus on CodeSearch, AI-native capability construction, and their synergistic applications with machine learning and natural language processing.

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym.
